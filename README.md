# :pushpin: These are my labs in Delphi 7 for the subject "Fundamentals of Algorithmization and Programming (Part 2)"

I did these labs in the first year of university in the second semester.

### :white_check_mark: Lab 1
In this lab, it was necessary to calculate an expression consisting of matrices.

### :white_check_mark: Lab 2
In this lab, it was necessary to compare two sorts: the selection method and the binary insertion method.

### :white_check_mark: Lab 5
In this lab, it was necessary to work out the use of the include directive.

### :white_check_mark: Lab 11
In this lab, it was necessary to develop a program for calculating the integral.

### :white_check_mark: MinMax task
Task condition:
There are 10 points on the plane, which are set by their coordinates. Find a point on the abscissa axis, the largest of the distances from which to the selected point would be the minimum.
